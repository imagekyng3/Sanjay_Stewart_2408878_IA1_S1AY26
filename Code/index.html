                    <h3>1. Resilient</h3>
                    <p>When things don't work out, I don't give up. I look at what went wrong, figure out a better way, and try again. Whether it's fixing broken code or handling personal setbacks, I stay focused on finding solutions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Academic Impact:</strong> This helps me push through tough assignments. When I'm stuck debugging for hours, I take a break, research alternatives, and come back with a fresh approach.</p>

                <article>
                    <h3>2. Driven</h3>
                    <p>I set clear goals and work consistently to reach them. Average results don't satisfy me—I want to do things well or not at all.</p>
                    <p><strong>Academic Impact:</strong> I go beyond minimum requirements. I practice coding outside class, study extra material, and ask questions until I fully understand concepts.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>3. Creative Problem Solver</h3>
                    <p>I look for different ways to solve problems. The first solution isn't always the best, so I test multiple approaches.</p>
                    <p><strong>Academic Impact:</strong> In projects, I suggest ideas others might not consider. This creativity helps me build unique features and think through user experience effectively.</p>

                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>I watch anime, play video games, and explore tech tools. Gaming taught me strategy and patience. Anime got me interested in storytelling. Trying new tech keeps me curious about how systems work.</p>

                    <p>Jesus is my hero because he demonstrated true strength through his actions. He stood firm in his beliefs regardless of the consequences, treated everyone with respect, and lived a life of service without compromising his values.</p>
                    <blockquote>"I am the way, the truth, and the life." – John 14:6</blockquote>
                    <p>His example teaches me that real integrity means aligning words with actions. That's the standard I aim for—being honest, consistent, and standing by my principles even when it's difficult.</p>

                    <h3>AI for Environmental Cleanup</h3>
                    <p>An AI-powered app that uses image recognition to identify and map litter in real-time. Users photograph trash, the system logs its location, and communities receive notifications about cleanup priorities in their area.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Local Application:</strong> Kingston faces significant issues with blocked drains and pollution. This app could partner with local businesses to reward cleanup participation. Schools could integrate it into community service programs, transforming waste management into a collaborative effort.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> Jamaica experiences tourism revenue loss and flooding partly due to inadequate waste management. This solution makes cleanup efforts visible and incentivizes behavioral change.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Ethical Concerns:</strong> Privacy issues from photos capturing faces or property. Potential system gaming through intentional littering for rewards. Limited smartphone and data access for lower-income participants.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> Implement automatic face and license plate blurring. Set daily reward caps per user. Enable offline functionality with delayed synchronization. Partner with community centers for shared device access.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Existing Solution:</strong> Litterati provides global crowdsourced litter tracking. Visit: <a href="https://www.litterati.org" target="_blank">litterati.org</a></p>

                <h2>Personal Development Reflections</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="section-content">
                <article>
                    <h3>Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn - Chapters 4-7</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Chapter 4: Achieve Your Goals</h4>
                    <p>Rohn emphasizes that dreams without written goals remain wishes. I've applied this by maintaining a goals journal where I write three specific, measurable objectives each Sunday. This practice transformed vague intentions like "improve coding skills" into concrete targets such as "complete web development assignment by Friday." The clarity from written, deadline-driven goals has significantly improved my productivity.</p>

                    <h4>Chapter 5: Use Time Wisely</h4>
                    <p>The chapter addresses time as life's most valuable resource. I implemented daily planning the night before and established focused work blocks with timed breaks. This eliminated hours previously lost to unproductive activities. Starting each day with a clear plan has recovered approximately two hours daily that I now invest in meaningful work and learning.</p>

                    <h4>Chapter 6: Surround Yourself with the Best People</h4>
                    <p>Rohn argues we become the average of our five closest associates. This prompted me to evaluate my relationships and prioritize time with goal-oriented peers and mentors. I joined study groups and engage more with professors. The shift in my environment has elevated my thinking—being around ambitious people naturally raises personal standards and expectations.</p>

                    <h4>Chapter 7: Be a Lifelong Learner</h4>
                    <p>The distinction between formal education (earning a living) and self-education (building success) resonated strongly. Technology evolves rapidly, making continuous learning essential. I now supplement coursework with documentation reading, tutorial videos, and studying developer repositories on GitHub. Expanding my knowledge beyond my major reveals useful connections across disciplines, ultimately strengthening my core competencies.</p>
