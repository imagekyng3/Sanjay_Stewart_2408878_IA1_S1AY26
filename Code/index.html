                    <h3>1. Resilient</h3>
                    <p>Setbacks don't stop me. When something goes wrong, I figure out what happened, learn from it, and try a different approach. Whether it's debugging code that won't compile or dealing with personal challenges, I keep pushing until I find a way through.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact on academics:</strong> This mindset helps me tackle difficult programming assignments. When I get stuck on a problem for hours, I take a break, research different solutions, and come back with fresh eyes instead of giving up.</p>

                    <h3>2. Driven</h3>
                    <p>I set goals and work hard to reach them. Mediocre results don't sit well with me. If I'm going to do something, I want to do it properly and see real results.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact on academics:</strong> This drive pushes me to go beyond just passing. I study extra material, practice coding problems outside of class, and ask questions when I don't understand something the first time.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>3. Creative Problem Solver</h3>
                    <p>I like finding new ways to solve problems. Sometimes the obvious solution isn't the best one, so I experiment with different approaches until something clicks.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact on academics:</strong> In group projects, I often suggest unconventional ideas that end up working well. This creativity helps me build unique features in my coding projects and think through user experience in ways others might miss.</p>

                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>I enjoy watching anime, playing video games, and exploring new tech tools. Gaming taught me strategic thinking and patience. Anime sparked my interest in Japanese culture and storytelling. Experimenting with tech keeps me curious about how things work under the hood.</p>

                    <h3>Jesus Christ</h3>
                    <p>Jesus is my hero because his life shows what real strength looks like. He stood up for what was right even when it cost him everything. He treated everyone with dignity, served others selflessly, and never compromised his values.</p>
                    <blockquote>"I am the way, the truth, and the life." – John 14:6</blockquote>
                    <p>What makes him my hero isn't just what he taught, but how he lived. He backed up his words with action. That's the kind of integrity I want in my own life—saying what I mean and following through, even when it's hard.</p>

                    <h3>AI for Environmental Cleanup</h3>
                    <p>I've been thinking about how AI could help tackle Jamaica's litter problem. My idea is an app that uses image recognition to identify and log trash in real-time. Users could take photos of litter, the app maps it, and local communities get notified about cleanup needs in their area.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>How it would work here:</strong> In Kingston, we have serious issues with blocked drains and pollution. This app could reward people (maybe through partnerships with local businesses) for reporting and cleaning up litter. Schools could use it for community service projects. It turns a frustrating problem into something people can actually solve together.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Jamaica loses tourism revenue and deals with flooding partly because of poor waste management. An app like this could change behavior by making cleanup visible and rewarding.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Ethical concerns:</strong> Privacy is a big one—photos might accidentally capture people's faces or homes. There's also the risk of the reward system being gamed (people littering just to clean it up for points). And not everyone has a smartphone with good camera and data access.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>My solutions:</strong> Auto-blur faces and license plates in photos. Cap daily rewards per user to prevent gaming. Make the app work offline with sync later, and partner with community centers where people can use shared devices to participate.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Real example:</strong> Litterati does something similar. They crowdsource litter data globally. Check them out: <a href="https://www.litterati.org" target="_blank">litterati.org</a></p>

                <article>
                    <h3>Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn - Chapters 4-7</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Chapter 4: Achieve Your Goals</h4>
                    <p>This chapter hit me because I've always had vague ideas about what I wanted, but never wrote them down properly. Rohn says dreams without goals are just wishes. He's right. When I started writing specific goals with deadlines—like "finish this web dev assignment by Friday" instead of "get better at coding"—I actually started making progress I could measure.</p>
                    <p>I'm applying this by keeping a goals journal. Every Sunday I write three specific things I want to accomplish that week. It's simple but it works because there's no confusion about what I'm aiming for.</p>

                    <h4>Chapter 5: Use Time Wisely</h4>
                    <p>The time chapter made me realize how much I waste. Rohn talks about how successful people guard their time like it's gold. I used to scroll through social media for hours without even noticing. Now I'm more intentional. I block out study time, set timers for breaks, and actually plan my day the night before.</p>
                    <p>The biggest change? Mornings. I wake up knowing exactly what I need to do instead of figuring it out as I go. That one shift saved me probably two hours a day that used to disappear into random browsing.</p>

                    <h4>Chapter 6: Surround Yourself with the Best People</h4>
                    <p>This one was uncomfortable because it made me evaluate my friendships. Rohn says you become the average of the five people you spend the most time with. I looked around and realized some people in my circle weren't going anywhere, and worse, they didn't want me to either.</p>
                    <p>I didn't cut anyone off harshly, but I did start spending more time with classmates who actually care about their grades and future. I joined study groups. I started asking my professors questions after class. The shift in my mindset has been noticeable—I think bigger now because I'm around people who think bigger.</p>

                    <h4>Chapter 7: Be a Lifelong Learner</h4>
                    <p>Rohn argues that formal education makes you a living, but self-education makes you a fortune. Tech changes so fast that if I only relied on what's taught in class, I'd already be behind. I started watching YouTube tutorials, reading documentation, and following developers on GitHub to see how they solve problems.</p>
                    <p>I also started reading more—not just tech books but books about business, psychology, and personal development. The more I learn outside my major, the more connections I see. It all feeds into making me better at what I do.</p>
